This repository contains the source code used in the thesis project
entitled
`Energy Consumption Modelling in IoT-surveyed Peacekeeping Missions` by
the author, presented at Universitat Jaume I, as a final thesis project
for the MSc. Geospatial Technologies. The main workflow is distributed
across Processing and Modelling modules. These are accessible through
the [`Data processing.md`](Data-processing.md) and
[`Modelling.md`](Modelling.md) files, respectively.

This project is the product of academy-ONG collaboration. The data used
in this work was shared by the [United Nations Global Service
Center](https://www.ungsc.org/) agency. Due to privacy concerns by the
provider, we only share the source code. However, we share the overall
results of the project in the following graphs. The methods and code by
the author are shared through the license in this repository.
