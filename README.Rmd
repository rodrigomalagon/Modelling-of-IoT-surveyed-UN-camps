# Energy Consumption Modelling in IoT-surveyed Peacekeeping Missions

Author: Rodrigo Malagón Rodríguez

Date: January 2025

This repository contains the source code used in the thesis project entitled
`Energy Consumption Modelling in IoT-surveyed Peacekeeping Missions` by the author, presented at Universitat Jaume I, as a final thesis project for the MSc. Geospatial Technologies. 

The project focuses on processing and modelling energy consumption data, captured by over 200 sensors located in a peacekeeping camp of the United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei (UNISFA) mission. Three main methods ---combining temporal and spatial dimensions--- were used in this work to build forecast models for power consumption: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), and Besag-York-Mollié (BYM). Theses model components rely on methods from Deep Learning and Statistics. The main workflow is distributed across Processing and Modelling modules. These are accessible through the [`Data processing.md`](Data-processing.md) and [`Modelling.md`](Modelling.md) files, respectively. 

This project is the product of academy-ONG collaboration. The data used in this work was shared by the [United Nations Global Service Center](https://www.ungsc.org/) agency. Due to privacy concerns, we only share the source code. However, to showcase the performance of our models, we share in the [Results](#results) section some output graphics. The methods and code by the author are shared through the license in this repository.

The complete research report of this project is available in the published [Project thesis](Project thesis.pdf`)
